# Task
Pick a common app screen (Spotify, Instagram, YouTube).

**Question:** _“How would you redesign this for someone who is colorblind / can’t hear / has shaky hands?”_

**Why?** Because design is about **inclusion**. You’ll start seeing how small tweaks can make apps usable for everyone.

# Submission

**App picked**: Spotify

**Tweaks**
- For someone who is colourblind
	- Ensure **high-contrast UI elements** (e.g., play/pause buttons, shuffle icons) so users don’t rely only on colour differences (like green vs. grey).
	- Use **icons + text labels** instead of colour alone to indicate states — for example:
	    - Instead of only showing a green shuffle button, also include a **“Shuffle: ON”** text label.
	- Allow users to choose from **colourblind-friendly themes** (e.g., deuteranopia, protanopia modes).
	- Make album covers and highlighted tracks distinguishable using **shapes, borders, or patterns**, not just coloured highlights.

- For someone who can't hear
	- This I don't understand. Tweaking spotify, an audio platform for someone who can't hear doesn't really make much sense to me. Some small tweaks like showing animations in the lyric window or having the option to run songs entirely on the lyric window ( a pause, next, previous, shuffle, repeat button etc) could allow them to enjoy the lyrics I suppose?

- For someone with shaky hands
	- **Increase tap target sizes** for buttons like play, skip, and queue — avoid small, crowded icons.
    - Add an **optional “steady mode”** where UI elements are more spaced out and accidental double taps are ignored.
    - Support **voice commands** (“Play next song”, “Pause”, “Like this”) so users don’t have to rely solely on precise touch.
    - Add a **confirmation step** for destructive actions (e.g., removing from playlist) to prevent accidental touches.
    - Allow **scroll locking or slower scroll speed** to make navigation easier.
