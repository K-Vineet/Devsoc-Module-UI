## Task
Let’s imagine:
“You’re hungry and want to order something from Swiggy.”

**Task:** Write all the steps you’d take, from opening the app → to payment → to waiting.

Then, mark:
- Where would you feel _frustrated_?
- Where would you feel _happy_?

**This is what designers call a User Journey Map** — spotting moments of frustration = spotting design opportunities.

## Submission
Steps:
1. Opening the app
2. Adding the food I want to order to cart
3. Adding coupons
4. Selecting address
5. Selecting payment method
6. Paying for the cart
7. Waiting for delivery partner
8. Food arrives: Yay!

Possible moments of frustration per step:
1. Once the app loads, it might take a while for restaurants to load
2. Choosing what to order.
	1. Wide variety of restaurants
	2. Wide variety of food items
	- Sometimes when I might not know what I want to eat, the huge variety might be a bit frustrating
3. Coupons have hidden terms that aren't clear at first. Coupons might be valid at first but after changing cart, they're suddenly invalid.
4. Adding a new address is tricky. Sometimes it doesn't get located correctly due to bad GPS. It chooses a different route automatically that doesn't work/is longer etc.
5. Payment options not loading. Desired payment option not working.
6. Payment fails, app hangs, app takes time to process payment which creates anxiety.
7. No updates from delivery partner, location tracking of delivery partner doesn't work correctly. Delays with no explanation. 
8. Cold food, missing items due to restaurant mix-up etc.

>2-3
>Supposing I choose what I want to order, there might not be photos of the food items and only descriptions. Insufficient descriptions.
>Example: 
>I want to eat a pizza. I decide to go for a new restaurant instead of dominoes. But there are no images of the pizzas. Only names and descriptions.

Possible moments of happiness:
1. Opening the app
	- Restaurants load quickly right after launch.
	- Personalized suggestions (e.g., “Your usual picks”) appear immediately.
	- Smooth animations and quick access to search/filter create a feeling of responsiveness.
2. Choosing what to order
	- The variety of restaurants and food feels exciting when you have a craving.
	- Clear categorization and filters (e.g., “Top-rated near you”) make decision-making easy.
	- High-quality images and detailed descriptions help visualize dishes.
	- Smart recommendations (“You ordered this last week”) reduce decision fatigue.
3. Adding coupons
	- Coupon terms are clearly visible upfront, no surprises later.
    - Coupons apply successfully on the first try.
    - If the cart changes, the app automatically suggests valid coupons.
    - A clear “You saved ₹___ 🎉” moment feels rewarding.
4. Selecting address
	- GPS is accurate and immediately picks up the correct saved address.
    - Adding a new address is smooth — auto-filled fields and correct pin on the map.
    - Delivery route is optimized without needing manual changes.
    - Familiar addresses give a sense of convenience (“Delivering to your usual spot 🍴”).
5. Selecting payment method
	- Payment options load instantly without errors.
    - Preferred payment method is available and pre-selected.
    - Saved payment info makes it a one-tap action.
    - Reassuring messages like “Secure UPI payment ✅” increase trust.
6. Paying for the cart
	- Payment goes through instantly without glitches.
    - A clear “Payment successful 🎉” screen appears.
    - No lag → no anxiety.
    - Smooth transition to order tracking gives confidence.
7. Waiting for delivery partner
	- Real-time updates show preparation, pickup, and route clearly.
    - GPS tracking is accurate and reliable.
    - Friendly delivery partner updates (“I’m on my way 🚴”) build trust.
    - Transparent communication during delays prevents frustration.

- Delivery partner is polite.
- Anticipation turns into satisfaction — a smooth journey ends with a reward.
- Optional quick feedback/rating provides a clean sense of closure.
