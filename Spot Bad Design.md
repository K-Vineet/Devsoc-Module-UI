**Your task:**

- Why is this bad?
- How would _you_ fix it?

**Hint:** There are no right or wrong answers here. It’s about _thinking critically_.

# Submission

	- A lack of lively elements
	- Small font
	- Monotonous theme
	- All of the links are underlined which make them look a little less appealing 
	- Inconsistency among the link texts- 
		- Some show date of updating 
		- Some show a one line description
		- Some show nothing at all
	- No sectioning
	- Small clickable areas
	- Uniform font. No typographic scale
		- All links have equal importance to a viewer. Which renders all of them with no importance.
